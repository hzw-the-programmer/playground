            The CSS attribute selector matches elements based on the presence or value of a given attribute.
            
            /* <a> elements with a title attribute */
            a[title] {
                color: purple;
            }

            /* <a> elements with an href matching "https://example.org" */
            a[href="https://example.org"] {
                color: green;
            }

            /* <a> elements with an href containing "example" */
            a[href*="example"] {
                font-size: 2em;
            }

            /* <a> elements with an href ending ".org" */
            a[href$=".org"] {
                font-style: italic;
            }

            /* <a> elements whose class attribute contains the word "logo" */
            a[class~="logo"] {
                padding: 2px;
            }
            
            [attr]
                Represents elements with an attribute name of attr.
            [attr=value]
                Represents elements with an attribute name of attr whose value is exactly value.
            [attr~=value]
                Represents elements with an attribute name of attr whose value is a whitespace-separated list of words, one of which is exactly value.
            [attr|=value]
                Represents elements with an attribute name of attr whose value can be exactly value or can begin with value immediately followed by a hyphen, - (U+002D). It is often used for language subcode matches.
            [attr^=value]
                Represents elements with an attribute name of attr whose value is prefixed (preceded) by value.
            [attr$=value]
                Represents elements with an attribute name of attr whose value is suffixed (followed) by value.
            [attr*=value]
                Represents elements with an attribute name of attr whose value contains at least one occurrence of value within the string.
            [attr operator value i]
                Adding an i (or I) before the closing bracket causes the value to be compared case-insensitively (for characters within the ASCII range).
            [attr operator value s] 
                Adding an s (or S) before the closing bracket causes the value to be compared case-sensitively (for characters within the ASCII range).
