  <p>Fixed positioning is similar to absolute positioning, with the exception that the element's containing block is the viewport.</p>
  <p>This can be used to create a floating element that stays in the same position regardless of scrolling.</p>
  <p>In the example below, box "One" is fixed at 80 pixels from the top of the page and 10 pixels from the left.
  <p>Even after scrolling, it remains in the same place relative to the viewport.</p>
