    Relatively positioned elements are offset a given amount from their normal position within the document, but without the offset affecting other elements.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the example below, note how the other elements are placed as if "Two" were taking up the space of its normal location.
  </p>
  <div class="box" id="one">One</div>
  <div class="box" id="two">Two</div>
  <div class="box" id="three">Three</div>
  <div class="box" id="four">Four</div>
