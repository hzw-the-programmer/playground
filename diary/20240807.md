走不开的快乐
  黄家驹

开开心心不应苦恼自缚
只须胸襟懂得变作深海
开开心心不应追究什么
只知通通不必介意
快乐也走不开，哦哦哦

世界总是灰暗冷冰
又话末世不断压迫
人人逃避与忐忑
繁华的都市
人群都失去感觉

世界每天不断竞争
道路亦有起伏变改
谁人能为你更改
平凡中的你
平凡中的我，不错

哦，不须抱怨跌倒了
快乐在暴风内寻
做人也会开心

开开心心不应苦恼自缚
只须胸襟懂得变作深海
开开心心不应追究什么
只知通通不必介意
快乐也走不开，哦哦哦

冷雨冷风锁着你心
若是为了这便叹息
锤头寻觅你的影
人群中的你
谁人可给你安慰

哦，不须抱怨跌倒了
快乐在暴风内寻
做人也会开心

开开心心不应苦恼自缚
只须胸襟懂得变作深海
开开心心不应追究什么
只知通通不必介意
快乐也走不开，哦哦哦

开开心心不应苦恼自缚
只须胸襟懂得变作深海

只知通通不必介意
快乐也走不开

开开心心不应苦恼自缚
只须胸襟懂得变作深海
开开心心不应追究什么
只知通通不必介意
