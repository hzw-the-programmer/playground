## Man in the mirror
     MJ

I'm gonna make a change for once in my life
it's gonna feel real good
gonna make a difference
gonna make it right

as I turned up the collar on my favorite winter coat
this wind is blowing my mind
I see the kids in the street with not enough to eat
who am I to be blind pretending not to see their needs
a summer's disregard a broken bottle top
and one man's soul
they follow each other on the wind ya know
cause they got nowhere to go
that's why I want you to know
I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
and no message could have been any clearer
if you wanna make the world a better place
take a look at yourself and then make a change

I've been a victim of a selfish kinda love 
it's time that I realize
there are some with no home
not a nickel to loan
could it be really me pretending that they're not alone
a willow deeply scarred somebody's broken heart
and a washed out dream
they follow the pattern the wind ya see
cause they got no place to be
that's why I'm starting with me
I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
and no message could have been any clearer
if you wanna make the world a better place
take a look at yourself and then make a change

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
and no message could have been any clearer
if you wanna make the world a better place
take a look at yourself and then make a change

stand up and lift yourself now
