午饭后刷了抖音，午休失败。
下午主要时间也刷抖音去了。后来强制看了会书。

哎！慢慢改了。不报太大希望。
就这样，无忧无虑的过吧。时间也不多了。过一天少一天。

以前为啥不学经济学呢？
通过看书获得多元知识体系，并运用。

马桶存在的缺点：重、安装难、坐着不舒服(考虑电动车上的智能座椅，根据家庭成员，自动调节)

瑞幸的本质是找到好的供应商，将产品按照瑞幸的需求进行定制，再通过平台销售实现网点配送，听起来有点像服装企业的买手。
思考：感觉小米，凡客也可能是这种模式。基于这种模式，可以开发模块化的IT系统，再运用到手机、服装、咖啡。

Payphone
  Wiz Khalifa / Maroon 5

I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone?
Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?

Yeah, I, I know it's hand to remember
The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That your're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try?
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time
When we called it "Love"
But even the sun
Sets in paradise

I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone?
Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?

If happy-ever-after's did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairytales are full of it
One more stupid love song, I'll be sick, oh

You turned your back on tomorrow
'Cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow
But you just gave it away
You can't expect me to be fine
I don't expect you to care
I know I said it before
But all of our bridges burned down
I've wasted my nights
you turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time
When we called it "Love"
But even the sun
Sets in paradise

I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone?
Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?

If happy-ever-after's did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairytales are full of it
One more stupid love song, I'll be sick, oh

Now, I'm at a payphone

Man, that
I'll be out spending all this money while you're sitting around
Wondering why it wasn't you who came up from nothing
Made it from the bottom, now when you see me, I'm stuning
And all of my cars start with the push of a button
Telling me I changed since I blew up or whatever you call it
Switched the number to my phone so you never could call it
Don't need my name on my shirt, you can tell that I'm balling
Swish, what a shame, coulda got picked
Had a really good game, but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top
Or what you could've saw, but sad to say it's over for
Phantom pulled up, valet open doors
Wished I'd go away, got what you was looking for
Now it's time who they want
So you can go and take that little piece of shit with you

I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone?
Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?

If happy-ever-after's did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairytales are full of it
One more stupid love song, I'll be sick, oh

Yeah, now, I'm at a payphone
