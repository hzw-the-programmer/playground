看书时睡着了。

在换马桶法兰圈时，脑子想怎么做就好了。之后就不要在脑子里一直纠缠，进而影响其他要做的事。

YMCA

Young man there's no need to feel down
I said young man pick yourself off the ground
I said young man cause you're in a new town
There's no need to be unhappy
Young man there's a place you can go
I said young man when you're short on your dough
You can stay there and I'm sure you will find
Many ways to have a good time

It's fun to stay at the YMCA
It's fun to stay at the YMCA
They have everything for you men to enjoy
You can hang out with all the boys
It's fun to stay at the YMCA
It's fun to stay at the YMCA
You can get yourself cleaned
You can have a good meal
You can do whatever you feel

Young man are you listening to me
I said young man what do you want to be
I said young man you can make real your dreams
But you go to know this one thing
No man does it all by himself
I said young man put your pride on the shelf
And just go there to the YMCA
I'm sure they can help you today

It's fun to stay at the YMCA
It's fun to stay at the YMCA
They have everything for you men to enjoy
You can hang out with all the boys
It's fun to stay at the YMCA
It's fun to stay at the YMCA
You can get yourself cleaned
You can have a good meal
You can do whatever you feel

Young man I was once in your shoes
I said I was down and out with the blues
I felt no man cared if I were alive
I felt the whole world was so tight
That's when someone came up to me
And said young man take a walk up the street
There's a place there called the YMCA
They can start you back on your way

It's fun to stay at the YMCA
It's fun to stay at the YMCA
They have everything for you men to enjoy
You can hang out with all the boys

YMCA It's fun to stay at the YMCA
Young man young man there's no need to feel down
Young man young man get yourself off the ground

YMCA It's fun to stay at the YMCA
Young man young man are you listening to me
Young man young man what do you wanna be
YMCA you'll find it at the YMCA
No man young man does it all by himslef
Young man young man put your pride on the shelf
YMCA and just go to the YMCA
