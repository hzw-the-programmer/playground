# lyrics

someone you loved
  Conor Maynard

I'm going under and I fear this time there's no one to save me
this all-or-nothing really got a way of driving me crazy

I need somebody to heal
somebody to know
somebody to have
somebody to hold

it's easy to say
but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

and now the day bleeds into nightfall
and you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

I'm going under and I fear this time there's no one to turn to
this all-or-nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you

now I need somebody to know
somebody to heal
somebody to have
just to know how it feels

It's easy to say
but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you helped me escape

and now the day bleeds into nightfall
and you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

and now the day bleeds into nightfall
and you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
