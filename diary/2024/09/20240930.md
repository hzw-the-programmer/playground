# life

今天A股涨8.06%，盈利4.68%，日入76883.61元
很激动，睡不着午觉。
去逛棕榈岛，喝了秋长咖啡。抖音上刷到3折66元打60个高尔夫球，进了球场。
如果A股不涨，我可能永远不敢进高尔夫球场。一直以为会员才能进球场。
要自信，信息要灵通。

我想要一个财务魔法师。帮我实现目标。

# issue log

* 今天在朋友圈做Rust题，一位北大计算机系的同学一眼就指出了我的错误。
  我瞬间感觉，我不适合做程序员了，只能当作爱好了。
  成为站在下一个一鸣旁边的人。

Halo
  Beyonce

remember those walls I built
well baby they're tumbling down
and they didn't even put up a fight
they didn't even make a sound

I found a way to let you in
but I never really had a doubt
standing in the light of your halo oh oh
I've got my angel now

it's like I've been awakened
every rule I had you breaking
it's the risk that I'm taking
I ain't never gonna shut you out

everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounding by your embrace
baby I can see your halo
you know you're my saving grace
you're everything I need and more
it's written all over your face
baby I can feel your halo
pray it won't fade away

I can feel your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo
I can feel your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo

hit me like a ray of sun
burning through my darkest night
you're the only one that I want
think I'm addicted to your light
I swore I'd never fall again
but this don't even feel like falling
gravity can't begin
to pull me back to the ground again
it's like I've been awakened
every rule I had you breaking
the risk that I'm taking
I'm never gonna shut you out

everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
baby I can see your halo
you know you're my saving grace
you're everything I need and more
it's written all over your face
baby I can feel your halo
pray it won't fade away

I can feel your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo
I can feel your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo

I can feel your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo
I can feel your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo

Halo
Halo

everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
baby I can see your halo
you know you're my saving grace
you're everything I need and more
it's written all over your face
baby I can feel your halo
pray it won't fade away

I can feel your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo
I can feel your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo

I can feel your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo
I can feel your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo
