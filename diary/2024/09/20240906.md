前同事说就业情况不好，心情沉重啊。
和面也浪费了大量时间。
花70块修燃气灶，师傅说修好了，但我感觉没解决问题，心里不爽。
最后刷抖音，然后睡了一会，又刷抖音，直到17：30才开始尝试静下心来。

people who are not investors have no idea what it feels like to try to sell something.
I have had a piece of real estate that I wanted to sell for months.
I would have welcomed any offer.
They could have offered me 10 pigs, and I would have been happy - not at the offer,
but just because someone was interested. I would have countered, maybe for a pig farm
in exchange. But that's how the game works. The game of buying and selling is fun.
Keep that in mind.
It's fun and only a game.
Make offers. Someone might say yes.

take classes, read, and attend seminars.
I search newspapers and the internet for new and interesting classes, many of which are free
or inexpensive. I also attend and pay for expensive seminars on what I want to learn. I am
wealthy and free from needing a job simply because of the courses I took. I have friends who
did not take those classes who told me I was wasting my money, and yet they're still at the
same job.

值的类型实现了Try，那么可以对该值使用？操作符，如：
```rust
fn test() -> Result<Foo, Bar> {
    let r = Ok(Foo);
    // let r = Err(Bar);
    let r = r?;
    Ok(r)
}
```
？操作符可以改写为如下代码：
```rust
fn test() -> Result<Foo, Bar> {
    let r = Ok(Foo);
    
    // let r = r?;
    let r = match r.branch() {
        ControlFlow::Continue(c) => c,
        ControlFlow::Break(b) => return FromResidual::from_residual(b),
    }
    
    // Ok(r)
    Try::from_output(r)
}
```
Result的Try实现如下：
```rust
impl<T, E> ops::Try for Result<T, E> {
    type Output = T;
    type Residual = Result<convert::Infallible, E>;
    fn from_output(output: Self::Output) -> Self {
        Ok(output)
    }
    fn branch(self) -> ControlFlow<Self::Residual, Self::Output> {
        match self {
            Ok(v) => ControlFlow::Continue(v),
            Err(e) => ControlFlow::Break(Err(e)),
        }
    }
}
impl<T, E, F: From<E>> ops::FromResidual<Result<convert::Infallible, E>> for Result<T, F> {
    fn from_residual(residual: Result<convert::Infallible, E>) -> Self {
        match residual {
            Err(e) => Err(From::from(e)),
        }
    }
}
```
特别注意from_residual中，From::from(e)，这是实现错误传递的关键。

饿狼传说
  张学友

她熄掉晚灯 幽幽掩两肩
交织了火花 拘禁在沉淀
心刚被割损 经不起变迁
她偏以指尖 牵引着磁电
汹涌的爱
扎着我尽力乱吻乱缠
偏偏知道爱令我无明天

她倚着我肩 呼吸响耳边
高温已产生 色相令人乱
君子在扑火 吹不走暖烟
她加上嘴巴 给我做磨练
汹涌的爱
扑着我尽力乱吻乱缠
偏偏知道爱令我无明天

爱会像头饿狼
嘴巴似极甜
假使走近玩玩它凶相便呈现
爱会像头恶狼
岂可抱着眠
它必给我狠狠的伤势做留念

她倚着我肩 呼吸响耳边
高温已产生 色相令人乱
君子在扑火 吹不走暖烟
她加上嘴巴 给我做磨练
汹涌的爱
扑着我尽力乱吻乱缠
偏偏知道爱令我无明天

爱会像头饿狼
嘴巴似极甜
假使走近玩玩它凶相便呈现
爱会像头恶狼
岂可抱着眠
它必给我狠狠的伤势做留念

爱会像头饿狼
嘴巴似极甜
假使走近玩玩它凶相便呈现
爱会像头恶狼
岂可抱着眠
它必给我狠狠的伤势做留念

爱会像头饿狼

假使走近玩玩它凶相便呈现
