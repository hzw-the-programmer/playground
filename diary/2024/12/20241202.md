# quotes
To dare is to lose one's footing momentarily.
Not to dare is to lose oneself.
  Soren Kierkegaard

When patterns are broken, new worlds emerge.
  Tuli Kupferberg

Feelings come and go like clouds in a windy sky.
Conscious breathing is my anchor.
  Thich Nhat Hanh

Greatness is a spiritual condition.
  Matthew Arnold

Before enlightenment, chop wood, carry water.
After enlightenment, chop wood, carry water.

when you change your understanding and your way of living,
then you can completely enjoy your new life in each moment.

In my amateur opinion, Dennis could have been suffering from attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder,
or ADHD, a condition that limited his ability to concentrate and caused him to get frustrated and act out in unpredictable ways.

# lyrics
you are not alone
  Michael Jackson

another day has gone
I'm still all alone
how could this be
you're not here with me
you never said goodbye
someone tell me why
did you have to go
and leave my world so cold

every day I sit and ask myself
how did love slip away
something whispers in my ear and says

that you are not alone
I am here with you
though you're far away
I am here to stay
but you are not alone
I am here with you
though we're far apart
you're always in my heart
but you are not alone

'lone 'lone
why 'lone

just the other night
I thought I heard you cry
asking me to come
and hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers
your burdens I will bear
but first I need your hand
then forever can begin

every day I sit and ask myself
how did love slip away
something whispers in my ear and says

that you are not alone
I am here with you
though you're far away
I am here to stay
but you are not alone
I am here with you
though we're far apart
you're always in my heart
but you are not alone

whisper three words and I'll come running
and girl you know that I'll be there
I'll be there

that you are not alone
I am here with you
though you're far away
I am here to stay
but you are not alone
I am here with you
though we're far apart
you're always in my heart
but you are not alone

that you are not alone
I am here with you
though you're far away
I am here to stay
but you are not alone
I am here with you
though we're far apart
you're always in my heart
that you are not alone
