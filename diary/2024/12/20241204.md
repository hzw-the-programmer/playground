# life
适当调整每天时间安排，serendipity
比如17:00点左右去散步。
或者，累了就去散散步。外面不热。

后悔过去、担心未来，会不知不觉进入大脑。
这时处于紧张状态，放松手脚和肩颈，专注做事。
越抵触，越会想的多。让它们来，让它们去。
没有解决当前问题的方法时，观察自己，慢慢地会有解决问题的方法涌现。

We are all failures ——— at least the best of us.
               J. M. Barrie

Fall down seven times. Stand up eight.

Connection is why we're here. It's what gives purpose and meaning to our lives.

Forget mistakes, forget failure, forget everything, except what you're going to do now and do it.
Today is your lucky day.

把自己变成糖，生活就甜了。

# lyrics
Hearts Aligned

found a heart in the quiet street
beating fast with every beat
eyes that speak a silent vow
we ain't got tomorrow just now

sitting there under city lights
two souls caught in endless nights
hands that touch like rare pearls
in your gaze my love unfurls

catch me in your warm embrace
time will stop and heal this space
every word a sacred tune
in this world I'm lost in you

we built dreams in a coffe shop
life's so sweet we never stop
laughing through the ups and downs
together we can paint this town

catch me in your warm embrace
time will stop and heal this space
every word a sacred tune
in this world I'm lost in you

hearts aligned without a plan
walking paths where love began
hold me close don't let me go
in your love I will always flow
