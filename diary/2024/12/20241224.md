# life
每天都要反思有没有做到放松自己。
看书、学Rust、写日记时，在旁边播视频，但不要把注意力集中到视频上，用余光看视频。

做到22:00点前上床。
睡眠很重要。一定要解决睡眠问题。

Sleeping in my car
  Roxette

I tell you what I got
I tell you what I do
been driving all night just to get close to you
baby baby I'm moving so fast
you better come on

the moon is alright
freeways heading south
my heart is going boom
there's a strange taste in my mouth
everything I'm moving real fast
so try to hold on
you try to hold on

sleeping in my car I will undress you
sleeping in my car I will caress you
staying in the backseat of my car making up oh oh

so come out tonight I'll take you for a ride
the silly old wagon, the radio is getting wild
baby baby moving so fast
I try to hang on
oh I try to hang on

sleeping in my car I will embrace you
sleeping in my car I will caress you
staying in the backseat of my car making love oh yeah

sleeping in my car I will possess you
sleeping in my car certainly bless you
laying in the backseat of my car making up oh

the night is so pretty and so young
the night is so pretty and so young
so very young

oh sleeping in my car I will undress you
sleeping in my car I will caress you
staying in the backseat of my car making love to you

sleeping in my car I will possess you
sleeping in my car suddenly bless you
laying in the backseat of my car making up making love

I will embrace you
I will embrace you yeah
I'm sleeping in my car
sleeping in my car
I will undress you
sleep in my car
the night is so pretty and so young yeah
