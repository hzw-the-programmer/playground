# life
中午没睡好。脑子安静不下来。
醒来后，也没准备好看书，而是去刷抖音，加大了脑子的混乱。

mc in the place to be

oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah 
oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah 

I know that you've been waitin' for it
I'm waiting too
in my imagination I'd be all up on you

I know you got that fever for me
hundred and two
and boy I know I feel the same
my temperature's through the roof

if there's a camera up in here
then it's gonna leave with me
when I do I do

if there's a camera up in here
then I'd best not catch this flick
on youtube youtube

cause if you run your mouth and
brag about this secret rendezvous
I will hunt you down

cause baby they be all up in my business
like a Wendy interview
but this is private
between you and I

touch my body
put me on the floor
wrestle me around
play with me some more

touch my body
throw me on the bed
I just wanna make you feel
like you never did

touch my body
let me wrap my thighs
all around your waist
just a little taste

touch my body
know you like my curves
come on and give me what I deserve
and touch my body

boy you can put me on you
like a brand new white tee
I'll hug your body tigher
than my favorite jeans
I want you to caress me
like a tropical breeze
and float away with you
in the Caribbean Sea

if there's a camera up in here
then it's gonna leave with me
when I do I do

if there's a camera up in here
then I'd best not catch this flick
on youtube youtube

cause if you run your mouth and
brag about this secret rendezvous
I will hunt you down

cause baby they be all up in my business
like a Wendy interview
but this is private
between you and I

touch my body
put me on the floor
wrestle me around
play with me some more

touch my body
throw me on the bed
I just wanna make you feel
like you never did

touch my body
let me wrap my thighs
all around your waist
just a little taste

touch my body
know you like my curves
come on and give me what I deserve
and touch my body

I'm gonna treat you like a teddy bear
you won't wanna go nowhere
in the lap of luxury
baby just turn to me
you won't want for nothing boy
I will give you plenty

touch my body
put me on the floor
wrestle me around
play with me some more

touch my body
throw me on the bed
I just wanna make you feel
like you never did

touch my body
let me wrap my thighs
all around your waist
just a little taste

touch my body
know you like my curves
come on and give me what I deserve
and touch my body

oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah
oh yeah oh yeah
oh oh oh oh yeah

touch my body
baby

just toch my body
on oh baby

touch my body

come on and give me what I deserve

touch my body
touch my body
