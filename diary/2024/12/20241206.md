早上看书时，睡着了。后来一直刷抖音到午休。午休后又刷了抖音。
这两天状态不是很好，有点抑郁。过去的事会不时浮现在脑中。
对未来不要抱有太大希望，就把现在做好就是了。
看书，做饭，写日记

Goldman Sachs Trading controlled banks and insurance companies that the
firm could encourage to buy the newly issued corporate securities that
Goldman Sachs was underwriting, while the controlled corporations generated
investment banking business for the firm.

The Lehmans liked to describe themselves as merchants of money, intermediaries
between men who wanted to produce goods and men looking for something to do
with their surplus funds.

Why not create companies that would use these exciting modern techniques of
finance and management and be free to go into any industry where opportunity
was particularly great and promising —— where experts in modern management
and finance could make the greatest gains for investors!

Investment trusts were designed to capitalize on the continuing growth
opportunities for American business, which many assumed were inevitable.

And not unlike the conglomerates of the 1960s, they specialized in "financial engineering"
as they concentrated on maximizing profits to shareholders.

Often using borrowed money and increasingly elaborate "senior" financing —— such as
preferred stock, convertible debt, convertible preferred stock, or debt with warrants
attached to buy equity —— the trusts raised capital to buy a controlling interest in operating companies.

They gained control of other corporations that, in turn,
controlled still other corporations as subsidiaries.

The layers of corporations controlling corporations that controlled still other corporations and
the opportunities for financial leverage seemed nearly endless. 

The remarkable extent of corporate pyramiding by investment trusts was illustrated by one retailer,
Metropolitan Chain Stores, whose dividends went through eight tiers of holding companies;
the cash dividends paid out to common-stock investors were what little remained after paying the
required dividends and interest expenses of all the layers of senior securities.

The idea of creating investment trusts seemed to open new horizons for financial creativity
to capitalize on the New Era in Ameriacan industry.

顺流逆流
  阿梨粤

不知道在那天边可会有尽头
只知道逝去光阴不会再回头
每一串泪水伴每一个梦想
不知不觉全溜走

不经意在这圈中转到这年头
只感到在这圈中经过顺逆流
每颗冷酷眼光共每声友善笑声
默然一一尝透
几多艰苦当天我默默接受
几多辛酸也未放手
故意挑剔今天我不在乎
只跟心中意愿去走
不相信未作牺牲竟先可拥有
只相信是靠双手找到我欲求
每一串汗水换每一个成就
从来得失我睇透

不经意在这圈中转到这年头
只感到在这圈中经过顺逆流
每颗冷酷眼光共每声友善笑声
默然一一尝透
几多艰苦当天我默默接受
几多辛酸也未放手
故意挑剔今天我不在乎
只跟心中意愿去走
不相信未作牺牲竟先可拥有
只相信是靠双手找到我欲求
每一串汗水换每一个成就
从来得失我睇透

每一串汗水换每一个成就
从来得失我睇透
