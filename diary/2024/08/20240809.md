无悔这一生
  黄家驹

阳光历次消散别去
无理冲击我心绪
前景没法打算怎么
谁会偷生远方里

每次记忆苦笑
将心意再变改
一分一秒
无意对一切话别
无意却远走他方

没有泪光风里劲创
怀着心中新希望
能冲一次
多一次
不惜自强

没有泪光风里劲创
重植根于小岛岸
如天可变风可转
不惜自强
这方向

无赖静听不舍心声
和我偏偏正呼应
前方或会一生奔波
无悔这一生经过

纵有冷风飘过
将心绪再痛逼
紧守不变

无意对一切话别
无意再远走他方

没有泪光风里劲创
怀着心中新希望
能冲一次
多一次
不惜自强

没有泪光风里劲创
重植根于小岛岸
如天可变风可转
不惜自强

没有泪光风里劲创
怀着心中新希望
能冲一次
多一次
不惜自强

没有泪光风里劲创
重植根于小岛岸
如天可变风可转
不惜自强
这方向

them, and set an example that it's okay to get something wrong.
It's not okay to undermine others by lying about something or cover your own ass

I do the same thing over and over, improving bit by bit.
There is always a yearning to achieve more.
I'll continue to climb, trying to reach the top, but no one knows where the top is.

terms what was wrong and that he expected it to get fixed. he didn't much care
what was required to fix it.

If he asked you to do something, you were expected to exhaust every method to
accomplish it. If you came back and said you tried and it coundn't be done,
he'd just tell you, "find another way."
