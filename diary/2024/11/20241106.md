Trump 团队是真会宣传，下面这首歌就是证明。音乐是载体，汽水是渠道。
得宣传渠道者，得天下。
Trump 团队剧本写得好，且有转危为机的能力。

Don Trump
  Yona tron

in the shadows
deals are made
promises broken
truth betrayed
power and money they're all the same
playing with lives like it's just a game

we're the ones left in the cold
while they count their silver and gold
we won't stay silent anymore
it's time to even the score

everyone knows trump is innocent
but the system's rigged gets evident
corruption runs deep in our land
we'll rise up and make our stand

rise as one to hide the truth
justice for sale to the highest youth
the voice of the people drowned in grief
but we won't back down we will succeed

we're the ones left in the cold
while they count their silver and gold
we won't stay silent anymore
it's time to even the score

everyone knows trump is innocent
but the system's rigged gets evident
corruption runs deep in our land
we'll rise up and make our stand

everyone knows trump is innocent
but the system's rigged gets evident
corruption runs deep in our land
we'll rise up and make our stand

from the streets to the halls of power
we'll fight for justice every hour
no more lies no more deceit
together we'll make our country a league

everyone knows trump is innocent
but the system's rigged gets evident
corruption runs deep in our land
we'll rise up and make our stand

everyone knows trump is innocent
but the system's rigged gets evident
corruption runs deep in our land
we'll rise up and make our stand

our stand lies are spun to hide the truth
justice for sale to the highest youth
the voice of the people drowned in grief
but we will succeed

everyone knows trump is innocent
but the system's rigged gets evident
corruption runs deep in our land
we'll rise up and make our stand

from the streets to the halls of power
we'll fight for justice every hour
no more lies no more deceit
together we'll make our country a league

everyone knows trump is innocent
