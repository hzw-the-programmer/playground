# life
午饭时刷了抖音，午休到5点。慢慢改。
上午看书时睡着了。

看代码时放松，不纠结细节。相信多看几遍，慢慢就看懂了。

傍晚在湖边看了喷泉。

Like that
  babymonster

I see that look upon your face
something my mind can not erase
If we keep staring then I might have to
might have to start to walk your way
I wanna hear what you would say
you got high standards and I do too

'Cause all those girls(They don't)
know what you need (They don't)
but I know, I know the way, the way
to make, to make sure you never leave

if I come close, baby, would you like that?
if I give some, would you give it right back?
If I show you that I know where it's at
baby, would you like that?
baby, would you like that?

say you want love, boy, I know what that means
make you feel way better than in your dreams
if I show you that I know where it's at
baby, would you like that?
baby, would you like that?

Yo, it's like that, like that
how you run it right back
know you on the right track
queen, ace, blackjack
I be thinking way too much
I neet to let it go
you be running through my mind
and I'ma let it show
'Cause ain't nobody stepping up to me
and saying nothing when I calling you
be running eye to eye we never fronting, yeah
we zoning bet we stunting on and on and on and
to the top, baby boy, we be rolling

'Cause all those girls(They don't)
know what you need (They don't)
but I know, I know the way, the way
to make, to make sure you never leave

if I come close, baby, would you like that?
if I give some, would you give it right back?
If I show you that I know where it's at
baby, would you like that?
baby, would you like that?

say you want love, boy, I know what that means
make you feel way better than in your dreams
if I show you that I know where it's at
baby, would you like that?
baby, would you like that?

I want you in my arms
In my arms, my arms(That's where you need to be)
in my arms, in my arms
my arms(that's where you need to be)
Ah-ah, ah-ah
But I know, I know the way, the way
to make, to make sure you never leave

if I come close, baby, would you like that?
if I give some, would you give it right back?
If I show you that I know where it's at
baby, would you like that?
baby, would you like that?

say you want love, boy, I know what that means
make you feel way better than in your dreams
if I show you that I know where it's at
baby, would you like that?
baby, would you like that?

if I come close, baby, would you like that?
if I give some, would you give it right back?
If I show you that I know where it's at
baby, would you like that?
baby, would you like that?

say you want love, boy, I know what that means
make you feel way better than in your dreams
if I show you that I know where it's at
baby, would you like that?
baby, would you like that?
