# life
最近一段时间，看视频过多，且过于放松了。
还是要向视频里面的优秀同学学习。延迟满足感，打持久战。锻炼忍耐力。

# lyrics
always remember us this way
  Lady Gaga

that Arizona sky
burning in your eyes
you look at me and babe, I wanna catch on fire
it's buried in my soul
like California gold
you found the light in me that I couldn't find

so when I'm all chocked up and I can't find the words
every time we say goodbye, baby, it hurts
when the sun goes down
and the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way

lovers in the night
poets tryna write
we don't know how to rhyme, but damn, we try
but all I really know
you're where I wanna go
the part of me that's you will never die

so when I'm all chocked up and I can't find the words
every time we say goodbye, baby, it hurts
when the sun goes down
and the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way

oh yeah

I don't wanan be just a memory, baby, yeah

so when I'm all chocked up and I can't find the words
every time we say goodbye, baby, it hurts
when the sun goes down
and the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way

way yeah

when you look at me and the whole world fades
I'll always remember us this way
