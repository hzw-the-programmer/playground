## morning
* 洗脸，整理床，散步，做操，洗澡
* 牛奶，面条，茶
* 看 McDonald's behind the arches
## afternoon
* 米饭 + 芹菜炒肉丝，葡萄柚

* 将洗过的主卧蓝黄色窗帘挂上

* 听歌写歌词
* 学会 axum

# life
不纠结问题。看到问题后，想解决办法。形成阶段性解决方案，何时时行动。不要浪费时间去想问题，又没解决问题。

good artists copy, great artists steal.

# lyrics
Viva La Vida
  Coldplay

I used to rule the world
seas would rise when I gave the word
now in the morning I sleep alone
sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
listen as the crowd would sing
now the old king is dead
long live the king

one minute I held the key
next the walls were closed on me
and I discovered that my castles stand
upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
be my mirror my sword and shield
my missionaries in a foreign field
for some reason I can't explain
once you go there was never
never an honest word
but that was when I ruled the world

it was the wicked and wild wind
blew down the doors to let me in
shattered windows and the sound of drums
people couldn't believe what I'd become
revolutionaries wait
for my head on a silver plate
just a puppet on a lonely string
oh who would ever want to be king

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
be my mirror my sword and shield
my missionaries in a foreign field
for some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
never an honest word
but that was when I ruled the world

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
be my mirror my sword and shield
my missionaries in a foreign field
for some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
never an honest word
but that was when I ruled the world
