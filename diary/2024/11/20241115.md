# life
既然用了朋友圈，就要去思考后面的实现原理。没有思路，在网上找找？

大概在12点到15点之间刷了抖音，浪费了大量时间。
因为在高位加了仓，一直担心股市，没能在形成方案后暂且放下，去阅读。
无论如何睡前都不应该玩手机。
如果一本书看不下去，可以换一本看。

# product ideas
* 把音乐和诗歌、画、手工、乐器结合起来。
* 听 She keeps me up 时，我想只听伴奏，或者只听伴奏中其中一种乐器，或者只听歌词。

She keeps me up
  Nickelback

she's got me nervous
talking a hundred miles an hour
she's more than worth it
I swear she smells just like a flower
I'd fall to pieces if I went anywhere without her
I love when she says, what's wrong with right here on the counter?

funky little monkey, she's a twisted trickster
everybody wants to be the syster's mister
caoca-cola roller-coaster
love her even though I'm not supposed to

funky little monkey, she's a twisted trickster
everybody wants to be the syster's mister
caoca-cola roller-coaster
love her even though I'm not supposed to

she keeps me up
she keeps me up
all night
all night

she keeps me up
she keeps me up
all night
all night

I need her so bad
sometimes I feel like I can taste it
this evil romance
so good I never wanna waste it
I can't trust my friends
'Cause she's what everybody chases
I know where she's been
'Cause it's on everybody's faces

funky little monkey, she's a twisted trickster
everybody wants to be the syster's mister
caoca-cola roller-coaster
love her even though I'm not supposed to

funky little monkey, she's a twisted trickster
everybody wants to be the syster's mister
caoca-cola roller-coaster
love her even though I'm not supposed to

she keeps me up
she keeps me up
all night
all night

she keeps me up
she keeps me up
all night
all night

I never wanna have to slow down
got to be a better way to come down
I've gotta stay awake some how

I never wanna have to slow down
got to be a better way to come down
I've gotta stay awake some how

funky little monkey, she's a twisted trickster
everybody wants to be the syster's mister
caoca-cola roller-coaster
love her even though I'm not supposed to

funky little monkey, she's a twisted trickster
everybody wants to be the syster's mister
caoca-cola roller-coaster
love her even though I'm not supposed to

she keeps me up
she keeps me up
all night
all night

she keeps me up
she keeps me up
all night
all night
