# quotes
The most meaningful way to differenciate your company from your competion,
the best way to put distance between you and the crowd,
is to do an outstanding job with information.
How you gather, manage, and use information will determine whether you win or lose.
  -- Bill Gates

what gets measured, gets managed.
  --- Peter Drucker

Saving people money so they can live better.
  --- Walmart

# digests
Who was the most interesting person you talked to this week?
How is a key technology trend (e.g., "Big Data") shaping our industry?
What are other companies (and competitors) doing that's working or not working?
What are our customers' sentiments? What is motivating them, and how have they changed?
Who are the key people in our industry that we should engage with?
What are the hiring trends in our industry?
Who are new entrants in the marketplace and which of them are doing interesting things?

what controls the quality of your life?
is it money? can you have a lot of money and still have a horrible life? yes or no?
is it relationships? can you have someone who totally loves you and still be miserable? yes or no?
so there is only two things control the quality of your life. please jot them down, for the rest of your life you want to remember,
the quality of life is controlled by two things, meaning and emotion.
the meaning you give to things controls the emotion that you feel.
people come up with different meanings and that produces different emotions and those emotions make you make different decisions.
when you're angry, you're going to decide diffrently than when you're playful or greatful or excited.
so the secret to life is, controlling meaning and emotion.
  --- Tony Robbins

you overthink because you don't write.
you are anxious because you don't act.
you procrastinate because you don't have a plan.
you stress because you don't train.
you lack clearity because you don't journal.
you feel lost because you have not searched for your purpose.
you seek validation because you haven't find it within yourself.
you feel overwhelmed because you try to control what's beyond your reach.
all your problems have a solution you just need to have the courage to take the first step.

戒不掉
  欧阳耀莹

今天开始新出发吗
留过了疤
忘记了吗

窗纱边餐台的配搭
曾经种花
如今暗哑

谁从屏幕里看从前
而谁停下企我门前
犹如是十八岁的青年很讨厌

谁人愿伴你到成年
停留尘俗世里浮潜
挽两臂伴你旅行如途中加冕

只可惜风景都错过
差一点方可亲吻我
喜欢这触摸俘虏我
而你怯懦

当天的街巷中碰过
吹起的烟圈中说破
心中这一位英俊少年的爱火
可烧伤我

huh hah hah
huh hah hah
huh hah hah

重新出发吗 huh
更渴望未来
以往这少年懂爱吗
仿佛不够
成长会进化吗
也信念自由
我爱这少年讽刺吗
这花开吗
这花开吗
