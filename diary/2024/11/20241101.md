午饭时刷了抖音，一直到午休，导致午休没睡好。慢慢改。
上午没刷抖音，很不错了。有改进。

看经济学原理时，没有放松，导致理解吃力。
应该像看 McDonald's behind the arches 那样放松。不懂不要紧，跳过，不要紧张。要愉悦。

等赚大钱了，把学府的房子，改成歌曲 APT. 里面的 아파트。party all night.

早上汽水推了APT这首歌，就一直循环播放。
看到 McDonald's behind the arches 的 Media Magic 那一章，里面有讲到 melody 和 lyric。
in 20 or 30 years, Rose gona have her the cilantro farm.
