# life
左手单手打字写下今天的日记。
右手大拇指痛。有一次团建喝醉了，3个同事送我回家，一个同事扭了我的右拇指，导致现在还痛。
为了避免喝酒等社交丑事发生，以后要记住3件事：
1. 听音乐
2. 看书
3. 散步，做操
营造能完成这3件事的环境。显然喝酒，无效社交不能营造这样的环境。
主动营造环境。

serendipity
尝试只用左手做事，这是很好的变换思路的方式。
以后可尝试其他限制，激发大脑。

# quotes
The way you do anything is the way you do everything.
  Tom Waits

Human beings are not born once and for all on the day
their mother give birth to them, but ... life obliges
them over and over again to give birth to themselves.
  Gabriel Garcfa Marquez 

If you live in the river you should make
friend with the crocodile.
  Indian Proverb (Punjabi)

It's more fun to be a pirate than to join the Navy.
  Steve Jobs

# digest
2. making choices from moment to moment that foster growth rather than fear;
4. being honest with yourself and taking responsibility for what you say and do instead of playing games or posing;
5. identifying you ego defences and finding the courage to give them up;
6. developing the ability to dermine your own destiny and daring to be different and non-conformist;
7. creating an ongoing process for reaching your potential and doing the work needed to realize your vision;
8. fostering the condition for having peak experiences, or what Maslow calls "moments of ecstasy" in which
   we think, act, and feel more clearly and are more loving and accepting of others.

Sitting and watching our breath is a wonderful practice, but it is not enough,
For transformation to take place, we have to practice mindfulness all day long,
not just on our meditation cushion. Why is this important? Because most of us -
basketball players included - spend so much time bouncing back and forth between
thoughts of the past and the future that we lose touch with appreciating the deep 
mystery of being alive.

祝福
  叶倩文

徘徊丛林迎着雨
染湿风中的发端
低诉细雨路遥若困倦
静靠湾湾小草倚清泉
悠悠流泉随路转
偶于山中转数圈
一片软软渐黄落叶
荡向清溪之中早飘远

啊过去过去多少次心乱
今天今天随着云烟渐远
听听鸟语静望雨丝飘断
悄悄的风赠我衷心
祝福一串

徘徊丛林迎着雨
染湿风中的发端
低诉细雨路遥若困倦
静靠湾湾小草倚清泉
悠悠流泉随路转
偶于山中转数圈
一片软软渐黄落叶
荡向清溪之中早飘远

啊送你送你祝福永不断
轻轻地飘寻觅无边路远
借那鸟语路上细添温暖
拜托清风奉上衷心
祝福千串

啊送你送你祝福永不断
轻轻地飘寻觅无边路远
借那鸟语路上细添温暖
叮嘱清风奉上衷心
祝福千串

拜托清风奉上衷心
祝福千串
