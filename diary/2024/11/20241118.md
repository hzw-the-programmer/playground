# life
身体的状态还是没调整好。

脑子里面纠结不重要的问题。老是看了就忘。

# lyrics
things you said
  Cody Fry / Abby Cates

I was walking in the woods one day
trying to keep the ghosts at bay
then I thought I say your face
but it was just leaves
I see you in the strangest things
your voice in every bird that sings
can they hear it echoing
or is that just me?
I don't believe in haunted houses
but I still see you there on the bed
you didn't leave me much but things you said
they stayed, they stayed

I was driving through the streets one night
at the corner with the bar you liked
I thought I saw the car you drive
but it wasn't green
these neighborhoods all look the same
that's why you had to move away
when people ask that's what I say
but they know I'm lying
I don't know who lives inside these houses
but you still live inside of my head
you didn't leave me much but things you said
they stayed, they stayed

I still see you
you still see me
we don't see each other anymore

I still love you
you still love you
we can't love each other anymore
can we?

I don't believe in haunted houses
but I still see you there on the bed
I wish I hadn't said all the things I said
