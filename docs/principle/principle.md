one of the most important decisions you can make
is who you ask questions of.

asking others who are strong in areas
where you are weak to help you 
is a great skill that you should develop no matter what,
as it will help you develop guardrails that will
prevent you from doing what you shouldn't be doing.

to understand what is coming at you,
you need to understand what happened before you.

meaningful relationships and meaningful work
are mutually reinforcing, especially when
sopported by radical truth and radical transparency.

the most meaningful relationships are achieved
when you and others can speak openly to each other
about everything that's important, learn together,
and understand the need to hold each other
accountable to be as excellent as you can be.

make sure people give more considerations to others
than they deman for themselves.

be generous and expect generousity from others.
