one of the most important decisions you can make
is who you ask questions of.

asking others who are strong in areas
where you are weak to help you 
is a great skill that you should develop no matter what,
as it will help you develop guardrails that will
prevent you from doing what you shouldn't be doing.

to understand what is coming at you,
you need to understand what happened before you.

meaningful relationships and meaningful work
are mutually reinforcing, especially when
sopported by radical truth and radical transparency.

the most meaningful relationships are achieved
when you and others can speak openly to each other
about everything that's important, learn together,
and understand the need to hold each other
accountable to be as excellent as you can be.

make sure people give more considerations to others
than they deman for themselves.

be generous and expect generousity from others.

earn more than you spend and invest that money well.

cultivate meaningful work and meaningful relationships.

People cannot be given the privilege of receiving information and then use the information to harm the company, so rules and procedures must be in place to ensure that doesn't happen.
For example, we provide great transparency inside Bridgewater on the condition that Bridgewater citizens do not leak it outside; if they do, they will be dismissed for cause (for unethical behavior).
Additionally, the rules for how issues are explored and decisions are made must be maintained, and because different people have different perspectives, it's important that the paths for resolving them are followed.
For example, some people are going to make big deals out of little deals, come up with their own wrong theories, or have problems seeing how things are evolving.
Remind them of the risks that the company takes to give them that transparency and their responsibilities to handle the information that they get responsibly.
I have found that people appreciating this transparency and knowing that they will lose it if it is not handled well leads them to enforce good behavior with each other.

It is the right and responsibility of management, and not the right of all employees, to determine when exceptions to radical transparency should be made.
Management should restrict transparency sparingly and wisely because every time they do, it undermines the idea meritocracy and people's trust.

There is nothing more important than understanding how reality works and how to deal with it. The state of mind you bring to this process makes all the diﬀerence.
I have found it helpful to think of my life as if it were a game in which each problem I face is a puzzle I need to solve. By solving the puzzle, I get a gem in the form of a principle that helps me avoid the same sort of problem in the future.
Collecting these gems continually improves my decision making, so I am able to ascend to higher and higher levels of play in which the game gets harder and the stakes become ever greater.

Understanding, accepting, and working with reality is both practical and beautiful. I have become so much of a hyperrealist that I’ve learned to appreciate the beauty of all realities, even harsh ones, and have come to despise impractical idealism.
Don’t get me wrong: I believe in making dreams happen. To me, there’s nothing better in life than doing that. The pursuit of dreams is what gives life its ﬂavor.
My point is that people who create great things aren’t idle dreamers: They are totally grounded in reality. Being hyperrealistic will help you choose your dreams wisely and then achieve them.

People who achieve success and drive progress deeply understand the cause-eﬀect relationships that govern reality & have principles for using them to get what they want. The converse is also true: Idealists who are not well grounded in reality create problems, not progress.
What does a successful life look like? We all have our own deep-seated needs, so we each have to decide for ourselves what success is. I don’t care whether you want to be a master of the universe, a couch potato, or anything else—I really don’t.
Some people want to change the world and others want to operate in simple harmony with it and savor life. Neither is better. Each of us needs to decide what we value most and choose the paths we take to achieve it.

Most people ﬁght seeing what’s true when it’s not what they want it to be. That’s bad, because it is more important to understand and deal with the bad stuﬀ since the good stuﬀ will take care of itself.

None of us is born knowing what is true; we either have to discover what’s true for ourselves or believe and follow others. The key is to know which path will yield better results.

Learning is the product of a continuous real-time feedback loop in which we make decisions, see their outcomes, and improve our understanding of reality as a result.
Being radically open-minded enhances the eﬃciency of those feedback loops, because it makes what you are doing, and why, so clear to yourself and others that there can’t be any misunderstandings.
The more open-minded you are, the less likely you are to deceive yourself—and the more likely it is that others will give you honest feedback. If they are “believable” people (and it’s very important to know who is “believable”), you will learn a lot from them.
Being radically transparent and radically open-minded accelerates this learning process. It can also be difficult because being radically transparent rather than more guarded exposes one to criticism. It’s natural to fear that.
Yet if you don’t put yourself out there with your radical transparency, you won’t learn.

You must be willing to do things in the unique ways you think are best – and to open-mindedly reflect on the feedback that comes inevitably as a result of being that way.

My experience, based on watching thousands of people try this approach, is that with practice the vast majority find it so rewarding and pleasurable that they have a hard time operating any other way.
This takes practice and changing one’s habits. I have found that it typically takes about eighteen months, which is how long it takes to change most habits.

All the laws of reality were given to us by nature. Man didn’t create these laws, but by understanding them we can use them to foster our own evolution and achieve our goals.

It’s important not to let our biases stand in the way of our objectivity. To get good results, we need to be analytical rather than emotional.
Whenever I observe something in nature that I (or mankind) think is wrong, I assume that I’m wrong and try to figure out why what nature is doing makes sense. That has taught me a lot.

For example, if you come up with something the world values, you almost can’t help but be rewarded. Conversely, reality tends to penalize those people, species, and things that don’t work well and detract from evolution.

Everything from the smallest subatomic particle to the entire galaxy is evolving. While everything apparently dies or disappears in time, the truth is that it all just gets reconfigured in evolving forms. Remember that energy can’t be destroyed—it can only be reconfigured
So the same stuff is continuously falling apart and coalescing in different forms. The force behind that is evolution.

This evolutionary cycle is not just for people but for countries, companies, economies—for everything. And it is naturally self-correcting as a whole, though not necessarily for its parts.
For example, if there is too much supply and waste in a market, prices will go down, companies will go out of business, and capacity will be reduced until the supply falls in line with the demand, at which time the cycle will start to move in the opposite direction.
Similarly, if an economy turns bad enough, those responsible for running it will make the political and policy changes that are needed—or they will not survive, making room for their replacements to come along.
These cycles are continuous and play out in logical ways—and they tend to be self-reinforcing.
The key is to fail, learn, and improve quickly. If you’re constantly learning and improving, your evolutionary process will look like the one that’s ascending.

It is instinctually that way, which is why most of us feel the pull of it – in other words, we instinctively want to get better at things and have created and evolved technology to help us.
History has shown that all species will either go extinct or evolve into other species, though with our limited time window that is hard for us to see.

To give you a quick example of nature creating incentives that lead to individuals pursuing their own interests that result in the advancement of the whole, look at sex and natural selection.
Nature gave us one hell of an incentive to have sex in the form of the great pleasure it provides, even though the purpose of having sex is to contribute to the advancement of the DNA. That way we individually get what we want while contributing to the evolution of the whole.
