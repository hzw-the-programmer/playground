one of the most important decisions you can make
is who you ask questions of.

asking others who are strong in areas
where you are weak to help you 
is a great skill that you should develop no matter what,
as it will help you develop guardrails that will
prevent you from doing what you shouldn't be doing.

to understand what is coming at you,
you need to understand what happened before you.

meaningful relationships and meaningful work
are mutually reinforcing, especially when
sopported by radical truth and radical transparency.

the most meaningful relationships are achieved
when you and others can speak openly to each other
about everything that's important, learn together,
and understand the need to hold each other
accountable to be as excellent as you can be.

make sure people give more considerations to others
than they deman for themselves.

be generous and expect generousity from others.

earn more than you spend and invest that money well.

cultivate meaningful work and meaningful relationships.

People cannot be given the privilege of receiving information and then use the information to harm the company, so rules and procedures must be in place to ensure that doesn't happen.
For example, we provide great transparency inside Bridgewater on the condition that Bridgewater citizens do not leak it outside; if they do, they will be dismissed for cause (for unethical behavior).
Additionally, the rules for how issues are explored and decisions are made must be maintained, and because different people have different perspectives, it's important that the paths for resolving them are followed.
For example, some people are going to make big deals out of little deals, come up with their own wrong theories, or have problems seeing how things are evolving.
Remind them of the risks that the company takes to give them that transparency and their responsibilities to handle the information that they get responsibly.
I have found that people appreciating this transparency and knowing that they will lose it if it is not handled well leads them to enforce good behavior with each other.
