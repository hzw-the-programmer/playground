Both plants and animals are small pharmaceutical factories,
casually churning out biochemicals that would make Genentech drool,
but neither a cell, nor an organ, nor an individual,
nor a species keeps track of these achievements --- what produces what.

It keeps no audited record of successes, of smart moves, of things that helped.

Lamarckian evolution.

IN THE LIBRARY OF FORM

The Method --- as evolution --- can be conceived of not as traveling but as breeding.

While I was within Borges's Library, I saw myself hunting for a readable book
over a trail that began at gibberish. But another looking in would see me breeding a
nonsense book into a viable book, just as one might domesticate a disorganized wildflower
into the elegant cup of a rose through many generations of selection.

Karl Sims breeds gray noise into jubilant images of plant life on the CM5.
"There is no limitation to what evolution can come up with.
It can surpass the design capabilities of humans,"

He wanted to demonstrate visually that while random selection and aimless wandering
would never produce a coherent design, cumulative selection (the Method) could.

"When you first evolve a new creature by artificial selection in the computer model,
it feels like a creative process. So it is, indeed. But what you are really doing
is finding the creature, for it is, in a mathematical sense, already sitting in
its own place in the genetic space of Biomorph Land."

IBM has been supporting artist William Latham's evolution experiments
because the global corporation realizes there is commercial potential here.
While Sim's evolution machine is, according to Latham, "a grammar that is
more ragged, more uncontrolled," Latham's is more controlled and useful
to engineers. IBM is turning the evolutionary tools Latham developed over
to automobile designers and having them mutate car body shapes. One of
the questions they are trying to answer is whether evolutionary design techniques
are more useful in the beginning of rough ideas or later in fine tuning,
or both. IBM intends to make a profitable project out of it. And not
only for cars. They imagine evolutionary "steering" tools useful for all kinds
of design problems entailing large numbers of parameters which require a
user to "back up" to a stored previous solution. Latham pictures evolution
taking root in packaging design, where the outer parameters are firmly fixed
(size and shape of the container), but where what happens within that space
is wide open. Here evolution can bring in multiple levels of detail that a
human artist would never have the time, energy, or money to do. The other
advantage of evolutionary industrial design, Latham has slowly come to realize,
is that it is perfectly suited to design by committee. The more people
that play, the better.

Owning an evolutionary pathway to a particular point demonstrates irrefutable
proof that the artist found that destination originally, since evolution doesn't
strike twice.

"effective searching procedures become, when the search-space is sufficiently
large, indistinguishable from true creativity.

To search the tapes, they must be watched, and therefore the information, time,
and energy needed to sort through all the tapes would exceed the information,
time, and energy needed to create the tape you wanted, no matter whate the tape was.

Evolution is a slow-witted way to outsmart this conundrum, but what we
call intelligence is nothing more (and nothing less) than a tunnel through it.

Breeding was once a craft belonging soely to the gardener. It is now
available to the painter, the musician, the inventor.
